## Lessons Learned

What did you learn while building this project? What challenges did you face and how did you overcome them?

Before starting this project, I did a little more planning, researching how to think like a developer so that I could have more of an understanding of the problem before jumping in. I broke the problem down and hacked away at the sub problems before linking it all together. I must admit, I did look at other solutions for inspiration, but in the end I managed to figure it out on my own.

Onwards and upwards.
